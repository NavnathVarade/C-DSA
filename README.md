## Overview

This repository focuses on providing clear and concise implementations of essential data structures and algorithms in C. The code is organized into different sections to facilitate easy navigation and learning.

## Data Structures

Explore various data structures implemented in C, including:

- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees)
- Graphs
- Hash Tables

## Algorithms

Discover well-commented C implementations of key algorithms such as:

- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Searching Algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search)
- Graph Algorithms (Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search)
- Dynamic Programming (Fibonacci Sequence, Knapsack Problem)
